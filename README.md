# yesno
not gonna lie, i'm pretty proud of myself for this yes or no script

this script took me way too long to figure out...
i can't believe something so simple require so much concentration to do

after getting this to work, i realized it was a good choice not majoring in anything to do with computer science back at UCLA
but then again, graduating with an bachelor's in international relations is really underwhelming compared to something science based.
maybe i shoulda never switched out of the physical science department

anyways, thanks for reading
